# RockPaperScissors
Classic game. Computer generates random element from r, p and s. App asks user for input (also r, p or s), and if anything else is provided by user, app asks until gets what it wants. Then user's and computer's moves are compared and result is prompted on a screen. At the end user is asked if want to play again.

Here I learned how to pick a random element from an array, and praticed some logic skills.
